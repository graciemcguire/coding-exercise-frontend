## Running the app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This means you have a web app, but don't need to worry about configuring anything.

Start by cloning the repo to your computer.


Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```
(or npm if you prefer)

This will install all the dependencies and run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload as you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
